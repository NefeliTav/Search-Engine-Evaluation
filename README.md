# Search Engine Evaluation
python3 search_engine.py \
I implemented 12 search engines , with different combinations of analyzers and scoring functions.
After indexing a collection of queries , i check the search engines in order to find the one with the best performance,
namely the one with the most relevant results.For this i use some standard algorithms,like p@k , mean reciprocal rank.
